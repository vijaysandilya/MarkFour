            <p>A marketer can only be as good as his understanding of his customer. Knowing the customer is pivotal to any marketing strategy. 
                Customer messaging which is the voice of any marketing campaign can only be effective if the target audience is understood properly. 
                Even the marketing channels will differ depending on the customer persona.
                I am going to come up with a customer persona for a specific product/service in this blog. 
                Before i delve more into this, let us look at what is a customer persona and how do we build it.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Customer Persona?</h2>

            <p>
                A customer persona is basically a mind map of your target segment which includes both demographic as well as psychographic details of the customer. 
                Demographics include details like target age, gender, income level, education level, geographical classification, job titles, etc. 
                Psychographics include details like interests, hobbies, personality of the customer etc. While demographics are more quantitative in nature, psychographics are more qualitative.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Ways to build a Customer Persona:
            </h2>

            <p>
                The way to build a good customer persona is to meet as many customers as possible and have meaningful conversations with them. 
                Some of the common ways of achieving this are sending out surveys to be filled by potential customers, having focus group discussions and having 1:1 customer interviews. 
                Survey results give you more quantitative feedback whereas group discussions and interviews give more qualitative feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my experience, I have worked as a Product Manager for B2C companies like Axis Bank handling Axis Pay UPI and Reliance Jio 
                handling JioChat and I can’t emphasise enough on how important it is to understand your customer and have the right kind of messaging across platforms and on all marketing collaterals. 
                When i joined Razorpay recently in the capacity of a Product Marketing Manager, I am now required to create a persona of a potential B2B client. 
                While there are a lot of similarities in the process of creating a Customer persona for a B2B/B2C business, there are some very big differences. 
                Through this article I would like to create a B2B persona for a target market i select and bring out the differences between the customer persona of a B2B company viz-a-viz a B2C Company.

                The Product: Marketing Services for E-Commerce companies in India
            </h2>

            <p>
                With the boom of Internet usage in India along with Smartphone penetration and the advent of Social Commerce, 
                the number of E-Commerce companies opening up is huge in number. Most of these e-commerce companies sell various types of products 
                online using shop front platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce etc or via social media (Instagram/FB etc). 
                The idea is to provide marketing services to these companies.
                I spoke to several E-commerce business owners to understand more about my customer persona 
                and the target segment and here are the results:
            </p>

            <h2>
                Target Segment:
            </h2>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Size of the Company: 5 to 500 People</li>
                    <li>Average Ticket Size: INR 100 — INR 5000</li>
                    <li>Decision Makers: Founder/CEO</li>
                    <li>Location: Anywhere</li>
                    <li>Industry: E-Commerce</li>
                    <li>Sub Vertical: Online Retail</li>
                    <li>Number of Monthly Orders: 500 to 1 lac</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>
                Customer Persona:
            </h2>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name: Mr. Sudeep Shivan</li>
                    <li>Job Title: Founder</li>
                    <li>Name of the Company: Style Fit</li>
                    <li>Industry: E-Commerce</li>
                    <li>What does the Company sell: Mens’ and Womens’ Apparel</li>
                    <li>Size of the Company: 25 people</li>
                    <li>Average Ticket Size: INR 1000</li>
                    <li>Monthly Orders: 3000</li>
                    <li>Type of Store: Shopify</li>
                    <li>Location: Bangalore</li>
                    <li>Organization Style: Flat Hierarchy with Open Door culture</li> 
                    
                    <li>Details of the Founder: Entrepreneurial in nature, attends a lot of networking events, is a workaholic, active on Social Media</li>
                    

                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Observe how the details of the company become more important along with the details of the decision maker. 
                The personality of a customer is viewed more from a professional lens than from a personal standpoint and 
                that is the major difference between the Customer persona for a B2B product vs a B2C product. 
                The decision makers are still people but these people represent a business rather than themselves.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
                B2B Marketing
            </h2>
            <p>
                Some of the other pointers to keep in mind for B2B marketing are:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>
                            Influences and Decision Makers
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            An influencer is a person who influences the process of buying a product whereas the decision maker is the one who actually buys a product. In a B2C product, the influencer and the decision maker are the same person more often than not, whereas in B2B products they are different sets of people. For a B2B product like Zoho, the influencer can be the HR team/HR head, the decision maker will be the CEO or the Finance head depending on the size of the company. Once this is understood, it will help focus all Marketing activities to the right set of audience.

                        </p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>
                            Understanding the Sales Conversion process
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            In the B2B world, understanding the Sales Conversion process is also very important to identify your customer persona correctly. And the most challenging part is that the Sales conversion cycle will be different for different organizations depending on the size of the organization as well as the nature of leadership.
                        </p>


                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>
                            Trust & Authenticity
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            It is very important to be Authentic in your communication especially in the B2B space. The average ticket size is much much higher and hence trust plays a very important role along with great customer service and post sales support.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                While i am still learning the perfect way to build a customer persona for a B2B product, to conclude understanding the finer details of the prospective companies along with the psychographic details of the decision makers and influencers goes a long way in the right direction.

            </p>

            <p>
                Hope this was helpful. Looking forward to hear your feedback. Cya untill next time :) And Happy New Year 2020!
